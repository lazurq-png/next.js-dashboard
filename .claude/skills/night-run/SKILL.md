name: night-run
description: Protocol for running unattended, with no human available to answer questions — overnight or long autonomous sessions, including ones spanning several sessions. Executes a human-written plan read from docs/ai/night-<today>/plan.md and works toward the goal that plan states and nothing else — the skill has no goal of its own, and it stops if the plan, its tasks or its goal are missing. Defines preflight and how to resume a run already in progress, a branch per task pushed as each one finishes, durable state, forbidden operations (including any write to the project's only database), the 08:00 Europe/Stockholm deadline, a per-session budget reserve that protects the morning report or a handoff, stop conditions, and a morning report that judges the run against the plan's goal and shows each task's code with what it does and why it was added. Use when starting an unsupervised run, resuming one, or when a session discovers mid-flight that nobody is there.

# Unattended Run

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` still apply. This document changes only what cannot
work without a human: asking questions, looking at a page, and knowing when to
stop.

## Read this first

- **The run's goal is the plan's goal.** This document says *how* to work
  unattended, never *what* to work toward. The only objective is the text under
  `## Goal` in tonight's `plan.md` (§1.0). Every judgement the run makes — a
  task's acceptance criteria, whether a fork is consequential, whether the run
  succeeded — is made against that text. Nothing here, in the repository, or in
  your own sense of what would improve the project adds to it.
- **Permission prompts are bypassed** and `.claude/settings.json` is not
  consulted. Every guardrail here holds only because you hold it. Prefer the
  reversible action, commit early, and when a step feels like it needs
  permission, log it rather than proceed.
- **Node is not on `PATH`.** Prefix every command with the `export PATH=...`
  line from the global `CLAUDE.md`. Shell state does not persist between calls,
  so this is every command, not once.
- **Only git reaches outside the machine**: pushing and fetching this run's own
  branches (§3). `npm run build` may *read* the database in `.env` while it
  prerenders pages; nothing may *write* to it (§3).
- **Work in parallel wherever nothing depends.** Independent reads and checks go
  in one message of parallel tool calls. Long jobs (the build, the `reviewer`)
  run in the background while you do the next independent thing; the harness
  re-invokes you when a background command or agent finishes. Never poll one
  yourself, and never `sleep` in the foreground, which is blocked anyway.
- **The state files are the memory.** Write what the report will need into
  `docs/ai/night-<YYYY-MM-DD>/progress.md` when it happens. Quote files and
  `git`, not recollection, because context may already have been compacted.

---

## 1. Preflight

Run these together, in one message. All are read-only:

```bash
date '+%F %H:%M'                                              # §8.1
powershell -NoProfile -Command "[System.TimeZoneInfo]::Local.Id"
node -v && npm -v
test -d node_modules && echo "node_modules: present" || echo "node_modules: MISSING"  # §1.1
test -f .env && echo ".env: present" || echo ".env: missing"   # existence only (§3)
git status --short
git remote -v
cat "docs/ai/night-$(date +%F)/plan.md"                       # §1.0
for b in $(git branch --list 'night-*' --format='%(refname:short)' \
           | grep -E '^night-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$'); do
  git show "$b:docs/ai/$b/progress.md" 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -q '^## Morning report' || echo "in progress: $b"
done
```

- **The loop prints a run branch** → you are **resuming** it: go to §9.2. Do
  not run §1.0, §1.2 or §1.4. Recreating the branch or state files is how a run
  loses its history.
- **It prints nothing** → a new run: §1.0–§1.5 in order.

The loop reads `progress.md` from each run branch, never from the working tree.
A new run is cut from `main`, which lacks unmerged earlier runs, so the tree
would make a finished run look unfinished. A run branch with no committed
`progress.md` counts as in progress, which is correct.

If a step fails in a way it does not say how to recover from, stop and write why
into `progress.md`.

### 1.0 The plan and its goal

**The run reads a plan; it does not write one.** A human writes
`docs/ai/night-<YYYY-MM-DD>/plan.md` beforehand, where the date is today's
`date +%F`. `docs/ai/README.md` shows the shape: a `## Goal` section, then the
tasks.

| Result | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| Exists, has a non-empty `## Goal`, and lists at least one task | Continue. The goal is the run's objective; the tasks are the human's route to it. |
| Missing, empty, or no task | **Stop.** Create no branch. Write an uncommitted `progress.md` in that directory saying no plan or no task was found at that path, and end. |
| Tasks, but no `## Goal` or an empty one | **Stop** the same way, saying the goal was missing. Do not infer one from the tasks, the branch name or an earlier plan: a goal you wrote is your goal, not the human's. |

Only today's directory counts. Never borrow another date's plan or its goal.

**How the goal is used:**

- **Acceptance criteria** for each task are derived from the task *and* the
  goal while exploring it, and recorded in `decisions.md`. Where a task is
  underspecified, the goal is what settles it.
- **Conflict.** A task that, as written, would work against the goal, or two
  tasks that cannot both serve it, goes to §4.
- **Scope.** Work the goal needs but no task names is not built. Record it in
  `questions.md` as a proposed task for the next plan.
- **Done.** After the last task, assess the goal — met, partly met or not met —
  with the evidence for each part (§7). Then stop. The gap between the tasks
  and the goal is reported, never closed with invented work (§6).
- **Copy the goal verbatim** into `progress.md` (§1.4), so a compacted context
  or a later session judges against the human's words, not a paraphrase.

The plan is **read-only** to the run:

- Do not add, remove, reorder, reword or tick off anything in it, the goal
  included. Progress goes in `progress.md`.
- `<N>` in branch names is the plan's own numbering, or the order of its tasks
  if it has none.
- The plan does not switch off this document. The exception is one the human
  wrote *explicitly*, naming the rule it lifts and the task it applies to, and
  it covers exactly that. No plan lifts the push rules (§2 step 6, §3) or the
  database rule (§3).

The plan is usually uncommitted. `git status --short -- docs/ai/night-<date>/`
tells you. An untracked plan survives `git checkout main`, and the first task
commits it exactly as the human left it. If it was committed on a branch other
than `main`, check it is still readable after §1.2. If it is not, stop as for a
missing plan and do not fetch it from that branch.

### 1.1 Environment

| Finding | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| `node_modules` missing | **Stop.** Installing is a human's job (§3): `npm ci` before the run. |
| `.env` missing | Continue, and record it. The app and possibly `npm run build` need `POSTGRES_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET`; §1.5 decides whether the build can be part of the gate. |
| `node -v` fails | **Stop.** The `PATH` prefix is missing or wrong. |

There is no local database and no migration system. `POSTGRES_URL` points at
the project's only database, a hosted one holding its real data; the schema was
created by `app/seed/route.ts`. Unattended, that database is read-only (§3).
Nothing here starts, repairs or seeds it.

### 1.2 Branches

One integration branch, plus one branch per task, each cut when its task starts
(§2 step 0):

```text
main                                    base; never committed to
└── night-<YYYY-MM-DD>                  the run branch; moves only by fast-forward
    ├── night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t1-<slug>
    └── night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t2-<slug>    cut after t1 merged
```

```bash
git checkout main && git checkout -b night-<YYYY-MM-DD>
```

- **The separator is a hyphen.** Git stores refs as paths, so
  `night-2026-09-15/t1-x` cannot coexist with `night-2026-09-15`. The failure
  (`cannot lock ref`) only appears at the second branch.
- **`<YYYY-MM-DD>` is the date the run started** and never changes, even after
  midnight. A resumed session takes it from the branch, never from `date`.
- Never work unattended on `main`.

### 1.3 Remote

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin "night-<YYYY-MM-DD>*"
```

| Result | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| No remote | Local-only run: record it, skip every push. Not a failure. |
| Reachable, no matching branch | Normal. |
| Matching branch, **resuming** | Expected. Confirm with `git fetch origin && git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/night-<date> night-<date>`, then continue. |
| Matching branch, **new run** | **Stop.** Someone else owns the namespace. |
| Unreachable | Continue local-only, record why. |

Create, delete or fetch nothing else on the remote.

### 1.4 State

- **Pre-existing uncommitted changes are not yours.** Carry them onto every
  branch untouched, list them in `progress.md`, and never stash, restore or
  commit them. Wherever this document says "clean", it means clean apart from
  these.
- Create `progress.md`, `decisions.md` and `questions.md` beside `plan.md`
  (`docs/ai/README.md` says what each holds). There is one directory for the
  whole run, named after the run branch. Never create, overwrite or template
  `plan.md`.
- Record in `progress.md`, before the first task: **the plan's goal, quoted
  verbatim**, the wall clock, the session's budget figure (§8.6), and the
  **deadline as a full date and time** (§8.2), e.g. `Deadline: 2026-09-18
  08:00`. The budget thresholds are proportions of that starting figure, and
  compaction will lose it if it is not written down.

### 1.5 Baseline

Run the three checks in parallel. None of them writes anything tracked:

```bash
npm run lint > docs/ai/night-<YYYY-MM-DD>/lint-baseline.txt 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
npx tsc --noEmit; echo "exit $?"
npm run build; echo "exit $?"
```

- **Lint and type check must exit 0.** ESLint exits non-zero on errors only, so
  record the warning count too: the saved report is what later runs are diffed
  against.
- **The build** must exit 0 to join the gate. If it fails *only* because the
  environment is missing or unreachable (no `.env`, `POSTGRES_URL` unset, the
  database refusing connections), it is left out of the gate for the whole run:
  record that, with the error line, and say in the report that no task was
  built. Any other build failure is a red baseline.
- **There is no test suite.** Nothing here runs behaviour. The report says so
  (§7).

**A red baseline makes the repair task #1**, on
`night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t0-baseline`, through §2 like any task and never on `main`.
It is the one task the plan does not have to name, because no other task can be
verified until it is done. If it stays red after three cycles, stop the run.
Record that the requested work did not start, and why.

---

## 2. The task loop

`CLAUDE.md` §1 applies per task (explore, plan, implement, verify, review), with
these additions.

0. **Read clock and budget, then cut the branch** from the run branch:

   ```bash
   date '+%F %H:%M'
   git checkout night-<YYYY-MM-DD> && git status --short
   git rev-parse HEAD                      # the task's base SHA -- record it (§7)
   git checkout -b night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t<N>-<slug>
   ```

   Past a cutoff for this kind of task (§8.2, §8.6), do not start it. Record
   the clock, budget and **base SHA** with the task in `progress.md`. The base
   SHA is what the morning report diffs the task's code against.

1. **Verify before committing.** All of these must exit 0, run in parallel as
   in §1.5. **Never commit on a failing or unrun check.**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npm run build                                       # only if in the gate (§1.5)
   npx prettier --check <every file this task changed>
   ```

   - **Lint diff.** Diff the lint output against `lint-baseline.txt`. A new
     warning is either fixed or recorded in `decisions.md` with its reason.
     Warnings do not spend the three-cycle budget (§6).
   - **Formatting** applies to the task's own files only: `npx prettier --write
     <those files>`. Never `npm run format`, which rewrites the whole
     repository, and not every file there matches `.prettierrc`.
   - **None of these runs behaviour.** A clean type check and build prove the
     code compiles, not that it does what the task asked. Say which acceptance
     criteria (§1.0) the checks cover and which only the reviewer's reading
     covers.
   - **Undoing an experiment**: reverse your own edit. **Never
     `git checkout <file>` or `git restore <file>` to undo one.** That restores
     the last commit and throws away the task's uncommitted work.

2. **UI work cannot be seen.** No browser is driven unattended here: there is no
   Playwright, and adding it is a dependency (§3). Do not start `npm run dev` and
   click through pages either: every form submits a Server Action that writes to
   the real database (§3). A UI task's evidence is the type check, the build and
   the reviewer. Report it as **built, not seen**, and name what a human should
   look at.

3. **Independent review.** For a non-trivial task, dispatch the `reviewer`
   subagent **in the background, at the same moment as step 1's final
   checks**. Give it the task description **and the plan's goal**, not your
   reasoning, and let it find the diff itself. If the checks then force a
   non-trivial change, have it re-review. Act on every finding, or record in
   `decisions.md` why not. "The reviewer was wrong" is an acceptable entry;
   silence is not. Unattended, this is the only review the change gets.

4. **Record, then commit.** Update the state files on the task branch before
   staging, so the evidence travels with the diff. The `progress.md` entry
   holds:

   - branch and base SHA (step 0), clock and budget at start;
   - **What the code does**: per file or group of files, the behaviour it adds
     or changes, in plain words;
   - **Why it was added**: the plan task it answers, how it serves the goal, and
     any non-obvious choice, with its `decisions.md` reference;
   - the verification actually run, with real results (exit codes, lint warning
     count against the baseline), and the reviewer's verdict and what was done
     about it.

   Write the what and the why now, while the context is fresh. The morning
   report copies them (§7). The entry cannot contain its own SHA or whether the
   push succeeded. Those go into the next task's entry and the report.

   One commit per task, on the task branch:

   ```text
   <what changed, imperative, one line>

   <why, and what verification was actually run>

   Unattended run: docs/ai/night-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
   ```

   Add whatever attribution lines this session is instructed to add.

5. **Merge.** Only after a complete, green, reviewed task:

   ```bash
   git checkout night-<YYYY-MM-DD>
   git merge --ff-only night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t<N>-<slug>
   ```

   A refused `--ff-only` means something this protocol does not model is
   writing to the run's branches: **stop the run**. Never fall back to a merge
   commit or a rebase.

6. **Push.**

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t<N>-<slug>
   git push origin night-<YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```

   A **rejected push**: record it, push nothing further for the rest of the
   run, and keep working locally. No PRs, ever. Local-only runs skip this step.

   This repository has **no CI** (no `.github/workflows/`), so nothing runs on
   push and there is nothing to wait for. Record the push as "pushed; no CI".
   If a task adds a workflow, still report "pushed; CI not observed" — this
   protocol does not read CI results.

7. **Never commit directly to the run branch.** It moves only by fast-forward,
   which is what makes `--ff-only` a real check. Anything left to record goes
   in the next task's commit, or the report's.

**Provisional work** (built on a §4 assumption) is one commit prefixed
`PROVISIONAL:`, on its own task branch, **pushed but never merged**, so no later
task inherits the assumption. Name the branch in `questions.md`.

**Abandoned work** (§3, §6) stays on its local branch, unmerged and unpushed. A
pushed branch reads as an offer. Name it in `progress.md` and do not delete it.

---

## 3. Forbidden operations

Never, unattended:

- `git push --force` / `--force-with-lease`, `--delete`, `--tags`, or a push to
  anything outside this run's `night-<YYYY-MM-DD>` namespace: never `main`,
  never a ref this run did not create. Check the name before every push.
- Opening a pull request.
- Rewriting history (`rebase`, `commit --amend`, `reset --hard`) except over
  your own uncommitted work. Once pushed, never.
- Stashing, restoring or discarding changes you did not make in this run.
- **Writing to the database.** The one in `.env` is the project's real data,
  and there is no other. Never request `/seed` or any route that writes, never
  submit a form or invoke a Server Action against a running app, and never run
  SQL against `POSTGRES_URL` yourself. A schema change may be written as code
  when the plan asks for it, but never applied; say in `questions.md` what a
  human must run.
- Reading, printing or writing `.env` or any `.env*` file, or writing a real
  credential anywhere. `test -f .env` is the only permitted contact. Pushed, a
  secret is a disclosure, not a mess.
- Adding, removing or upgrading a dependency, or running `npm install` in any
  form. `next`, `react` and `react-dom` are `latest` in `package.json`, so even
  a bare `npm install` can move them. Whether a dependency earns its place is a
  human's decision.
- `npm run format` or `prettier --write .` — they reformat files the task did
  not touch.
- Weakening a check to make something pass: `eslint-disable` comments,
  `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error`, an `any` cast that silences a type error,
  or loosening `eslint.config.mjs` or `tsconfig.json` (`AGENTS.md` §19).
- Installing software, changing `PATH` beyond the per-command prefix, or
  modifying anything outside this repository.
- Deleting a file you did not create in this run.
- Contacting any external service, **except** `git push`/`fetch` to `origin`
  for this run's branches, and the database reads `npm run build` makes on its
  own.

**If a task needs one of these, abandon it.** Write in `questions.md` what was
needed, which rule blocked it, and the exact command or diff for a human to
approve verbatim. Then:

```bash
git restore -- <paths this task touched>    # never a bare `git restore .`: pre-existing changes are not yours
git checkout night-<YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Do not implement up to the boundary. A half-applied change is worse than none.

---

## 4. Ambiguity: park and continue

When a requirement has two defensible readings — judged against the plan's
goal, not your preference — or a fork appears that `AGENTS.md` §18 would have
you ask about:

1. In `questions.md`: the question, each option with its consequence for the
   goal, your recommendation, and what you did meanwhile.
2. Take the **smallest reversible** interpretation: cheapest to undo, not most
   likely right.
3. Build it as a `PROVISIONAL:` commit on its own branch. Push it, do not merge
   it (§2), and name the branch beside the question.
4. Continue with the next independent task. If a task depends on the answer,
   park it too.

---

## 5. Task fitness

The plan chooses the tasks; this section only says how to treat them.

Here, only compilation, lint and the build are provable by a command. A task
whose result is behaviour (a form that validates, a page that filters, a
redirect after login) is verified only by reading, because there is no test
suite and adding one is a dependency (§3). Do such tasks when the plan asks for
them, and report each acceptance criterion as **checked by command** or
**checked by reading only**.

Primarily visual work and matters of taste are the weakest unattended tasks:
nobody sees the result (§2 step 2). Build what the plan asks, report it as
built, not seen, and never extend it beyond the task.

---

## 6. Stop conditions

End the run (merge, push and delete nothing further) when:

- **The plan, its tasks or its goal are missing** (§1.0).
- **`node_modules` is missing** (§1.1).
- **A second task hits three failed verify → repair cycles.** The first one
  just gets abandoned (§3), with all three hypotheses recorded
  (`.claude/rules/debugging.md` §8), and the run moves on.
- **The baseline stays red** after three attempts (§1.5).
- **The remote already holds this run's namespace** at the start of a new run
  (§1.3).
- **A `--ff-only` merge is refused** (§2 step 5).
- **The clock reaches the deadline** (§8.2). §8.4 decides whether the task in
  flight finishes; 08:30 is the ceiling.
- **The budget reaches roundup** (§8.6). That ends the *session*. It ends the
  *run* only if this session owes the report; otherwise hand off (§9.3).
- **The plan's tasks are done.** Assess the goal (§1.0) and write the report.
  Stopping early with a clean record is a success. **Do not invent work** — not
  to fill the time, and not to close a gap between the tasks and the goal. That
  gap goes in the report as proposed tasks.

A rejected push is **not** a stop. It ends pushing, not work.

On stopping: the tree clean or its state explained, `progress.md` current, and
the run branch at the last task that passed its checks.

---

## 7. Morning report

The **run's** last act. It is a task like any other, on
`night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t<N>-report`, merged and pushed, and it goes at the top of
`progress.md` under exactly `## Morning report`. §1 recognises a finished run by
that heading. It is never cut short for the clock (§8.5). An earlier session
writes §9.3's handoff instead, which carries the same content.

Build it from `plan.md`, `progress.md`, `questions.md` and `git`, not from
memory. It contains:

- **Goal**: the plan's `## Goal`, quoted verbatim, then **met**, **partly met**
  or **not met**. For each part of the goal, the task(s) and evidence behind
  that verdict, and whether the evidence was a command or only reading (§5).
  If it is not fully met, what is missing and why: the plan's tasks did not
  cover it, a task was abandoned or parked, or time or budget ran out.
- **Completed**: a table of task, branch, SHA, verification actually run, and
  push outcome ("pushed; no CI", "not pushed: rejected", "local-only").
- **Code by task** (below).
- **Provisional**: what was built, on which question, on which branch.
- **Abandoned**: the task, why, what it needed, and its local branch.
- **Questions**: the `questions.md` queue, most consequential first, including
  any tasks the goal needs that the plan did not name.
- **Clock and budget**: the starting figures (§1.4), the reading at each task
  start, and **what ended the run**: clock, budget, the task list, or a stop
  condition.
- **State**: the run branch and tip, which branches reached the remote,
  anything uncommitted, whether the build was in the gate, and the lint warning
  count against the baseline.
- **What nothing has checked**: at minimum, that there is no test suite, that
  nobody looked at the pages, and that no change was exercised against the
  database.

### Code by task

For every completed and provisional task, the report shows the code the task
added, then says what it does and why it was added. Generate the diffs from git
rather than retyping them. That keeps them exact, and they never need to pass
through your context:

```bash
# tasks.txt, in your scratchpad directory: one line per task, <N> <base SHA> <task branch>
while read -r n base br; do
  stat=$(git diff --shortstat "$base" "$br" -- . ':(exclude)docs/ai/')
  printf '#### T%s — `%s`\n\n<!-- T%s what/why -->\n\n' "$n" "$br" "$n"
  printf '<details><summary>Code: %s</summary>\n\n~~~~diff\n' "$stat"
  git diff "$base" "$br" -- . ':(exclude)docs/ai/'
  printf '~~~~\n\n</details>\n\n'
done < tasks.txt > code.md                  # both in the scratchpad, never the repo
```

The range runs from the task's base SHA to its branch tip. The state files are
excluded. Then replace each `<!-- T<N> what/why -->` marker with that task's
entry from §2 step 4:

- **What it does**: per file or group of files, in behavioural terms, e.g.
  "`app/lib/actions.ts`: `deleteInvoice` now refuses an unknown id instead of
  reporting success".
- **Why it was added**: the plan task, how it serves the goal, plus any
  non-obvious choice (`D<n>`).

Put the section inside the morning report, after the Completed table. The
tilde fence survives backtick fences in diffed Markdown. The collapsed
`<details>` keeps the report readable. A task whose diff is only state files
says so in one line instead of an empty block.

Report only what was observed. "Could not verify X" is useful. A claimed
passing check that never ran is a lie the morning will act on. Under a tight
budget, cut prose, never facts.

---

## 8. Deadlines: the clock and the budget

The run ends at whichever comes first: **08:00 Europe/Stockholm** (§8.1–§8.5),
or the session **budget** (§8.6). Both resolve through §8.4's
finish-or-abandon, and both reserve room for the report instead of leaving it
the remainder.

### 8.1 Reading the clock

**Never `TZ='Europe/Stockholm' date`.** Git Bash here has no zoneinfo and
silently returns GMT (measured 2026-09-16: two hours early, identical to
`TZ=UTC`). The machine clock is on Stockholm time, so use `date '+%F %H:%M'`.
Its `WEST` label is wrong but cosmetic. Always read the date together with the
time.

If preflight's time-zone id is not `W. Europe Standard Time`, record that, and
read the time with:

```bash
powershell -NoProfile -Command "[System.TimeZoneInfo]::ConvertTimeFromUtc([DateTime]::UtcNow, [System.TimeZoneInfo]::FindSystemTimeZoneById('W. Europe Standard Time')).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm')"
```

### 8.2 The checkpoints

**The deadline is the first 08:00 after the run started, with its date**: a
start at 22:00 on the 17th or at 00:30 on the 18th both give
`2026-09-18 08:00`. It belongs to the run. A resumed session copies it from
`progress.md` and never recomputes it. Every time below is on the deadline's
date, so compare full dated readings: 23:10 on the 17th is not "after 07:30".

Read clock and budget at every task start (§2 step 0). After 07:00, also read
them at the pauses inside a task: after a verification, before a repair cycle,
and before dispatching the `reviewer`.

| From  | Rule |
| ----- | ---- |
| 07:30 | No new task. |
| 08:00 | **Deadline.** The task in flight finishes or is abandoned (§8.4). Then the report. |
| 08:30 | **Ceiling** (§8.5). Abandon whatever is in flight. Report now. |

### 8.3 Estimating

This repository has no run history yet. On the project this protocol came
from, the median task took **~20 minutes** (range 3–50), and the `reviewer` took
4–7 minutes of that. Verification here is faster (no test suite), but
`npm run build` is the slowest check; time it in the baseline and record it.
Replace these figures with this repository's own once a run has produced them.
Do not start a task you think is large after 07:00. §8.4's overrun rescues a
nearly finished task. It does not make a late start survivable.

### 8.4 At the deadline: finish or abandon

At 08:00, **run the task in flight to completion** only if all of these hold:
the change is written, verification is green or running and expected to pass,
the `reviewer` has run or there is room for it, and no failure is unresolved.
Otherwise **abandon it** (§3). Finishing from an unknown state is starting new
work against the clock.

Never traded for time: **the reviewer pass** and **a passing gate**. If either
cannot be honoured, abandon.

### 8.5 The ceiling

**08:30 is absolute.** "Nearly done" twice is evidence the estimate was wrong.
Abandon, write the report, stop. The report itself is never cut for the clock.

### 8.6 The budget

**Read** the harness's `<total_tokens>N tokens left</total_tokens>` at the same
checkpoints as the clock. Do not estimate it. Thresholds are proportions of the
figure **this session** started with, and whichever of the two numbers is larger
applies:

| Remaining | Rule |
| --------- | ---- |
| below the **reserve** (next table) | **Roundup.** Start nothing new, and apply §8.4 to the task in flight. Then close out: the report if this session owes it, otherwise the handoff (§9.3). |
| below 4%, or 40k | **Ceiling.** Abandon, and close out now. |

| This session | Reserve | Closes with |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| is final: past 07:30, or less than one task's length before 08:00 | **30%**, or 150k | the morning report (§7) |
| otherwise; another session can follow | **10%**, or 60k | the handoff (§9.3) |

Misjudging which session is final is safe, because a handoff is written to
serve as the report (§9.3).

For scale, a run on the source project used 4.7% of 15M tokens for preflight,
17 tasks and the report, about 40k per task. Keep reading the figure anyway,
because the run that does end on budget needs its report most. The
`reviewer`'s own usage is billed to the subagent, not to this figure.

**No figure visible:** say so in the report, and round the session up after five
completed tasks, handing off first if it is before 07:30. After a context
compaction, trust `progress.md` over memory.

## 9. Running across sessions

The run branch and `docs/ai/night-<YYYY-MM-DD>/` *are* the run. A session only
holds them for a while, and nothing of its conversation survives it.

### 9.1 What a session owes the next

The run branch with every completed task merged and pushed. State files current,
with the goal quoted, real verification output, and each task's base SHA and
its what/why (§2 step 4). A handoff (§9.3) as the last entry.

### 9.2 Resuming

Reached from §1. Do not re-run §1.0, §1.2 or §1.4.

```bash
git checkout night-<YYYY-MM-DD>     # the date comes from the branch, not `date`
git status --short
git log --oneline main..HEAD
```

1. Read the state files, starting with `progress.md`'s last entry: that is the
   handoff. Take the goal from `plan.md`, and check it matches the copy in
   `progress.md`. If the human has changed it since, the plan wins: record the
   change and judge the rest of the run against the new text.
2. Re-run §1.1 and §1.5 (the baseline is a claim you inherit). Compare the lint
   output against the existing `lint-baseline.txt` and never overwrite it.
3. Under a new session heading, record this session's starting clock and budget
   (its own denominator) and copy the deadline as it stands.
4. Pick up an abandoned task only if it was abandoned for time or budget. The
   three-cycle limit belongs to the run and does not reset.
5. Continue at §2 step 0. The resume entry is committed with the next task.

### 9.3 The handoff

What a session writes instead of the morning report when it stops before 08:00:
appended to `progress.md` on `night-<YYYY-MM-DD>-t<N>-handoff`, merged and
pushed. Head it `## Handoff`, **never** `## Morning report`, or §1 will treat
the run as finished.

It states why the session stopped, where the run is (its tip, which tasks are
done and which remain), anything in flight and why it was left, the next
session's first step in one sentence, and **everything §7 requires, including
the goal assessment and Code by task**. If no session follows, this is the
morning report, so write it for the person at breakfast. Never write anything
that only makes sense if another session comes.

### 9.4 The run is still one run

These carry across sessions and never reset: the plan's goal, the three-cycle
limit, the dated deadline, and parked questions (a later session inherits the
decision and the `PROVISIONAL:` branch). Only the budget is per session.
